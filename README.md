# Part 0: Introduction 

Hello there, I hope you'll are doing fine well I finally have gained the courage to start this project (it took about 2 weeks to convince myself to even start this, I wanted to start this project after I placed a bet against my friend ;D). I've never written a compiler that can compile itself. So that's where I'm headed on this magical journey(i am listening to Harry Potter Book-3 E04).

As part of the process, I'm going to write up my work so that you'll can follow along. This will also help me to clarify my thoughts and ideas. Hopefully you, and I, will find this useful!
